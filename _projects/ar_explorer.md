## AR in the Explorer App

In collaboration with the Museum's Digital team and consulting directly with Museum scientists, we developed five augmented reality (AR) experiences in the Museum's [Explorer App](https://www.amnh.org/apps/explorer) with the goals to highlight opportunities to augment underserved exhibits around the museum and surface real scientific data for visitors. The following are the five experiences that can be found throughout the Museum:

### T. rex skeleton, 4th floor

View a 1-year-old T. rex skeleton and explore morphological differences between juveniles and adults.

### Pterosaur, 4th floor

View the actual size of a Quetzalcoatlus or an animated scaled-down version in flight.

### Mako shark, Hall of Biodiversity

### Leotoli footprints, Hall of Human Origins

Compare human, chimp and Lucy footprints. Highlight in-line toesâ€”bipedalism evolved long before other human-like traits, such as big brains.

### Bats, Hall of Extinct Mammals

Highlight morphology to compare fruit-eating and other types of bats
