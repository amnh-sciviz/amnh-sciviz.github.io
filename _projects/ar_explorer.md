## AR in Explorer App

In collaboration with the AMNH Digital team, we produced five augmented reality (AR) experiences, which are embedded in the Museum’s [Explorer App](https://www.amnh.org/apps/explorer), a self-guided tour and wayfinding app for visitors. We worked with Museum scientists to acquire, visualize and animate data assets. All experiences were designed to enhance exhibits on display in the Museum.

### <i>T. rex</i> skeleton, Hall of Saurischian Dinosaurs

Compare a baby <i>T. rex</i> skeleton (in AR) to the adult on display. Young <i>T. rex</i> had comparatively longer arms and legs, and a smaller jaw—evidence that its role was closer to pursued prey than fearsome predator.

### Pterosaur, Hall of Vertebrate Origins

Stand face-to-chest with the giraffe-sized <i>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</i> (in AR), a model developed from the only fossil of this pterosaur species discovered: a single arm bone (on display). See a scaled-down <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i> in flight, an animation based on biomechanical models.

### Mako shark, Hall of Biodiversity

### Leotoli footprints, Hall of Human Origins

Compare human, chimp and Lucy footprints. Highlight in-line toes—bipedalism evolved long before other human-like traits, such as big brains.

### Bats, Hall of Extinct Mammals

Highlight morphology to compare fruit-eating and other types of bats
