## AR in Explorer App

In collaboration with the AMNH Digital team, we produced five augmented reality (AR) experiences, which are embedded in the Museum’s [Explorer App](https://www.amnh.org/apps/explorer), a self-guided tour and wayfinding app for visitors. We worked with Museum scientists to acquire, visualize and animate data assets. All experiences were designed to enhance exhibits on display in the Museum.

### <i>T. rex</i> skeleton, Hall of Saurischian Dinosaurs

Compare a baby <i>T. rex</i> skeleton (in AR) to the adult on display. Young <i>T. rex</i> had comparatively longer arms and legs, and a smaller jaw—evidence that its role was closer to pursued prey than fearsome predator.

### Pterosaur, Hall of Vertebrate Origins

Stand face-to-chest with the giraffe-sized <i>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</i> (in AR), a model developed from the only fossil of this pterosaur species discovered: a single arm bone (on display). See a scaled-down <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i> in flight, an animation based on biomechanical models.

### Mako shark, Hall of Biodiversity

View a life-sized Mako shark up close in AR. See how it swims and uses a protractible jaw to catch tuna. We animated a CT scan of a Mako skeleton to complement a physical model on display.

### Leotoli footprints, Hall of Human Origins

Compare 3D scans of footprints (in AR) from three great apes. Can you tell who’s a two-legged walker and who walks on all fours? Using depth data from <i>Australopithecus</i> fossil footprints (on display) and from plaster casts of human and chimp footprints, we demonstrated how scientists deduce that our extinct cousin was bipedal.

### Lyle’s Flying Fox (fruit bat), Hall of Advanced Mammals

There are over 1,300 known bat species, each with a unique skull shape. Visitors enlarge and explore CT scans of three bat skulls (in AR) to experience this variety. And in the physical exhibit, they learn about the adaptations that drive bat diversity.
