## CT scans in AR & VR (prototypes)
In 2017, we produced prototypes of digital experiences across multiple emerging media platforms using CT scans provided by museum scientists. We conducted user testing to help guide the Museum's emerging-media strategy. Here are some of those prototypes. 

### VR Weevil
We developed an immersive, VR experience around the CT scan of a root weevil. Users enter a virtual orange grove, click on a leaf, and are suddenly standing on the leaf by a human-sized weevil. They explore the insect to learn about its wing structure and the fascinating way insects breathe. A soundscape adds to the immersion.

### AR Shark

Working with CT scans of a mako shark, we produced an animated, interactive digital asset to augment the mako shark model hanging overhead in the Hall of Biodiversity. We developed versions for Microsoft’s Hololens (a headset) and Google’s Tango (a tablet). Later, we used this digital asset to produce a finished experience, the <a href="https://amnh-sciviz.github.io/ar-explorer/" target="_blank">AR shark featured in the Museum’s Explorer app</a>.

### AR with Holocube

We used CT scans of the mako shark and  weevil, as well as a microfossil and a bat skull, to develop a Holocube experience that required  less facilitation than the other prototypes. Manipulating the Holocube in one hand, and viewing it through the camera of a tablet, visitors could examine the scans as 3D images on the screen. They could rotate the specimen by turning the cube, and even go inside the specimen by bringing the cube closer to the camera.
