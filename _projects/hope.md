## Hall of Planet Earth Climate Wall

The [Hall of Planet Earth's climate change section](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/planet-earth/what-causes-climate-and-climate-change) features a media wall comprised of 36 high-definition 55-inch screens with “big-picture” messages about climate change. Below them, content panels and interactive stations based on data from organizations including NASA and NOAA (the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration) explore three main themes: How Climate Works, Our Warming World, and Consequences of Climate Change.
