## Tree of Life game

We developed a smartphone-based game that has visitors build an evolutionary tree by comparing three species at a time and determining which two are more closely related. The game introduces players to a fundamental practice in evolutionary biology: scientists often use the "three-taxon statement" method to place newly discovered species in the evolutionary tree. To make deductions about relatedness, players are given hints about morphology and behavior, and are encouraged to look closely at dioramas on display in the Museum halls for clues. The game is a popular addition to the [Explorer app](https://www.amnh.org/apps/explorer), a self-guided tour of AMNH exhibits for visitors.

To explore how we could expand the reach of the Tree of Life game, we developed and tested two prototypes: a multiplayer touchtable version, and a tablet-based game. 

### Tree of Life touchtable (prototype)
In this tree building game, four players are given a supply of game pieces, free-floating nodes with animal silhouettes on them that drift around like air-hockey pucks. When one is touched, its name is displayed. Each player is given a colored quadrant with their own root node on which they build a tree. As game pieces are dragged near the tree, potential links fade in. As the pieces are moved around, different connection points are available. One of these is the correct location for this animal. If a piece is released near the right place, it's pulled into the tree. If the wrong place, it is ejected. Difficulty naturally rises as the tree grows. There are more possible connection points, and right answers grow less obvious.
