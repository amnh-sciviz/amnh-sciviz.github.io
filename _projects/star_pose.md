## Star Pose

Star Pose is a gesture-based interactive new installation, in the [Cullman Hall of the Universe](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/the-universe), that is available on a periodic basis at the 13-foot-wide and 8-foot tall Astrobulletin. As a visitor steps toward the screen, they are flown from Earth to star constellations including Orion (‘The Hunter’) or Scorpius (‘the Scorpion’), and asked to mimic the shape – or pose – of each. While most depictions of the night sky are typically flat, ‘Star Pose’ aims to highlight the fact that the stars exist in three-dimensional space, with the shape of each changing as you move towards it.
