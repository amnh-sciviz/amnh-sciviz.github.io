## AR Shark

Working with CT scans of a mako shark and consulting directly with Museum scientists John Maisey and John Denton, we produced an animated, interactive digital asset for the Hall of Biodiversity to augment the mako shark model hanging overhead. We developed versions for Microsoftâ€™s Hololens (a headset) and Google's Tango (a tablet).
