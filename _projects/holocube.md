## CT Scans with Holocube

We used the CT scan of the mako shark, as well as scans of a microfossil, weevil and ghost bat, to develop a [Holocube](https://mergevr.com/cube) experience that required much less facilitation than our first prototype. Manipulating the Holocube in one hand, and viewing it through the camera of a smartphone or tablet, visitors could examine the scans as 3D images on the screen. They could rotate the specimen by turning the cube, and even go inside the specimen by bringing the cube closer to the camera. Additional touchscreen features allowed them to play with the specimens in other ways (e.g., watching the shark swim and bite; bisecting the microfossil into halves).
