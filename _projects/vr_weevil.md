## Prototypes


### VR Weevil
Working with Museum scientist Steve Davis, we developed an immersive, VR experience around the CT scan of a root weevil. Users enter a virtual orange grove, click on a leaf, and are suddenly standing on the leaf by a human-sized weevil. They explore the insect to learn about its wing structure and the fascinating way insects breathe. A soundscape adds to the immersion.

### AR Shark

Working with CT scans of a mako shark and consulting directly with Museum scientists John Maisey and John Denton, we produced an animated, interactive digital asset for the Hall of Biodiversity to augment the mako shark model hanging overhead. We developed versions for Microsoftâ€™s Hololens (a headset) and Google's Tango (a tablet).
