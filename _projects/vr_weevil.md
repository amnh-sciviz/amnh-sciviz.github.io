## Prototypes


### VR Weevil
Working with Museum scientist Steve Davis, we developed an immersive, VR experience around the CT scan of a root weevil. Users enter a virtual orange grove, click on a leaf, and are suddenly standing on the leaf by a human-sized weevil. They explore the insect to learn about its wing structure and the fascinating way insects breathe. A soundscape adds to the immersion.

### Tree of Life

In this tree building game, four players are given a supply of game pieces, free-floating nodes with animal silhouettes on them that drift around like air-hockey pucks. When one is touched, its name is displayed.

Each player is given a colored quadrant with their own root node on which they build a tree. As game pieces are dragged near the tree, potential links fade in. As the pieces are moved around, different connection points are available. One of these is the correct location for this animal. If a piece is released near the right place, it's pulled into the tree. If the wrong place, it is ejected.

Difficulty naturally rises as the tree grows. There are more possible connection points, and right answers grow less obvious.
