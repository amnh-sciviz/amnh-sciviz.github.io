## <i>T. rex: Skeleton Crew</i>

<i>T. rex: Skeleton Crew </i>is AMNH’s first interactive VR experience. We developed the wireless, multiplayer experience in partnership with HTC VIVE and in collaboration with Immersion VR. It’s featured in the Museum’s special exhibition <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/t-rex-the-ultimate-predator" target="_blank"><i>T. rex: The Ultimate Predator</i></a>, running March 2019-August 2020. Learn more about the project in this behind-the-scenes trailer.

In the four-minute VR experience, players work together to build a <i>T. rex</i> fossil skeleton and then watch it come to life as the modern world transforms into Hell Creek, Montana 66 million years ago. Here’s a taste of what players see.
