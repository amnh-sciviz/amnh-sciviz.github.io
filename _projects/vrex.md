## <i>T. rex: Skeleton Crew</i>

<i>T. rex: Skeleton Crew </i>is AMNH’s first interactive VR experience. We developed the wireless, multiplayer experience in partnership with HTC VIVE and in collaboration with Immersion VR. It’s featured in the Museum’s special exhibition <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/t-rex-the-ultimate-predator" target="_blank"><i>T. rex: The Ultimate Predator</i></a>, running March 2019-August 2020. Learn more about the project in this behind-the-scenes trailer.

In the four-minute VR experience, players work together to build a <i>T. rex</i> fossil skeleton and then watch it come to life as the modern world transforms into Hell Creek, Montana 66 million years ago. Here’s a taste of what players see.

### Single-player version
We also developed an extended, single-player version of the game, which is <a href="https://www.viveport.com/apps/38908318-8887-4ca8-aec5-af10fec00d0e/American_Museum_of_Natural_History's_T._rex:_Skeleton_Crew/" target="_blank">avaialble for download</a> on Viveport. Because this version is removed from the educational context of the <i>Ultimate Predator</i> exhibition, we produced a series of animated videos, presented by AMNH paleontologist Mark Norell, which players activate by clicking on parts of the <i>T. rex</i> skeleton or objects in the scene.
